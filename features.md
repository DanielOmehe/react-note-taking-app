Your users should be able to create notes, ’to-do‘ lists, and Wikis. A Wiki in the context of a note-taking app would be quite like a website. Users should be able to create and edit the layout of it.
The app should support all popular platforms like Android and iOS.
Users should be able to use it offline, furthermore, it should synchronize when they have the mobile Internet connection back.
Increasingly, users find the folder structures in the project management and note-taking tools hard to manage. The new app should instead allow them to create nested pages.
With the hectic pace of our lives, it’s important to enable users to collaborate. I mean, multiple users should be able to edit a document simultaneously or comment on it, even when other users read it.
The ’User Interface‘ (UI) should be free from distraction.
A performant and fast app is important for a function like note-taking.
Good note-taking apps should allow drag-and-drop.
